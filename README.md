# oktrack
OKR Tracker (OKtRack) tool for company-wide tracking of personal and team OKR progress.

This is WIP so don't expect a tool to be available any day. It'll take time and I'll update this description accordingly.

# Key features
The key features of this tool are to provide a means to

* define missions and visions for a company, department and/or team
* define department, team and personal objectives in alignment with missions and visions
* define key results per objective 
* vote (+1) on key results (either your own or your colleagues)
* see relevant (and all) OKRs for the organization and the votes
* make non-personal OKRs semi-private, ie. hide information about votes to anyone but you
* send/remind users to vote (+1, or ACHIEVED!)

Implement other features to enable 360degree feedback for a whole organization.

# Ideas

Provide a toolbar app for OSX/Linux/Windows? to quickly see your personal and team OKRs and vote on OKRs through a quick-search. Also reflect other users votes on your personal or team's OKRs by giving some kind of feedback.

Provide a simple URL to implement OKR information (data, graph, ...) via IMG-tag into HTML content.

Anything else?
